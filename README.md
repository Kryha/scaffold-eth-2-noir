# Scaffold-ETH Noir

Sandbox project for testing age-restricted contracts using [Noir](https://noir-lang.org/) for writing ZKP-circuits. Also has *basic* dynamic UI for expirimenting with circuits and proof-generation. This was built using Scaffold-ETH 2, [refer to SE2 README for set-up](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2#readme).

* requires [nargo](https://noir-lang.org/dev/getting_started/nargo_installation) (tested with v0.10.1)

# Inspiration
- Age proof circuit from "[noir by example](https://noir-by-example.org/gadgets/zk-age-verification/)"
- Noir-wasm set-up from "[noir-starter](https://github.com/noir-lang/noir-starter)"



## signature

Alice recognizes that, in order for her to not having to share her age with the balloon store, she at least has to share her age with a third party that the balloon store also can trust. In this case, the balloon store has selected the Town Hall to be the trusted third partyüèõ. Alice accepts that she has to share her age with the Town Hall.

When the balloon store implemented their zero knowledge proof solution they made sure that they are using the same format as the Town Hall for constructing the claim that is being signedüìú.
TTODOTODOTODOTODOTODOTODOTODOTODOTODOODO! In this project the claim construction can be found in `packages/nextjs/pages/example-zk/BirthDateSignature.tsx`(`signBirthYear`) and `packages/noir/circuits/LessThenSignedAge/src/main.nr` (`construct_claim_payload`).

What the Town Hall actually signes is that they confirm that Alice is born on a certain year AND that she has control over a certain Ethereum address. The check of Alice's Ethereum address is not done in this example.

The code for producing the signature now includes the Town Hall's hardcoded private key. This can be improved in many ways, but at a minium it should be provided to the UI by a Town Hall employee.

## generate proof
One of the reasons that Alice knows that she is not sharing her birth year with anyone is that the proof generation is open source, and she herself can double check the code. Furthermore she can even generate the proof‚úÖ herself locally. This is actually what we are doing now.
TTODOTODOTODOTODOTODOTODOTODOTODOTODOODO! In `packages/nextjs/utils/noir/noirBrowser.ts` you can see that we are importing from `@aztec/bb.js` and `@noir-lang/acvm_js`, but we could also generate this proof with `nargo prove`. We are also using the predefined circuit-ABI byte code from `packages/nextjs/generated/circuits.json`, but we could re-compile it using `nargo compile`.

## free balloons
Public & private inputs
The ballon store is using the same `TokenVendor.sol` as the [speed run Ethereum challange](https://speedrunethereum.com/challenge/token-vendor), with some additions. They've added a function `redeemFreeToken`, with the `onlyKids`-modifier. The modifier constructs the public inputs and calls the proof-verifier (`packages/hardhat/contracts/verifiers/LessThenSignedAge.sol`). The public inputs is part of the information that was used to generate the proof. They are needed to show what we are actually proving.

Now Alice gets a balloonüéà _token_, that she can redeem at the store to get an actual ballloon.


## further reading/thinking
- What differences in implementation would it mean for just using birth year and birth date. Circuit-construction.
- What's different with age restriction with proving "older then" instead?
- What happens with this contract in two years? (updating verifier)
- How can you change so that we instead trust multiple third parties, and the user can choose?
- How would you go about to create the proof using `nargo prove`?
- What happens if Alice shares her privateKey with Bob who is 14 y/o, is there something stopping him from getting a free balloon?
