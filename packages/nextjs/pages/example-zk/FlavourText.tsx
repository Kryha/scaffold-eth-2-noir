          Alice has heard that balloon store in town is handing out balloons🎈 to anyone who is 10 years old or younger.
          However, Alice does not want to share her age with anyone. Lucky for her, the balloon store has a zero
          knowledge proof solution. This means she can claim her balloon🎈 and only share as little information as
          necessary publicly. Here is how she would go about...
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside">
          <li>
            First, she needs to find a trusted third party🏛 that can give her an official signature📜 that she is born
            in a specific year.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then, she needs to generate a zero knowledge proof✅. It should prove that the signed birth year is greater
            then or equal to {yearTenYearsAgo} and that the signature📜 is done by a known public key.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, Alice can call the balloon store&apos;s age restricted contract with her proof✅ and get a
            balloon🎈.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </>
